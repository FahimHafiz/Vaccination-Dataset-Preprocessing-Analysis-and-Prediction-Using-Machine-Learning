# Vaccination-Dataset-Preprocessing-Analysis-and-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

## Overview
In this repository, we analyze a synthetic vaccination dataset from Bangladesh (Thanks to CHRF, Bangladesh). This project involves cleaning the dataset, performing statistical analyses to uncover patterns, and applying machine learning models for predictive analysis. The goal is to explore how various factors relate to patient outcomes and to predict these outcomes based on available features.

## Folder Structure
The repository is organized as follows:


### Folder and File Descriptions
- **datasets**: Contains the raw data files used in this analysis.
  - **Hospital_data_after_Vaccination.csv**: Data from hospitals after patients received vaccination.
  - **Hospital_data_before_Vaccination.csv**: Data from hospitals before patients received vaccination.
  - **Lab_data.csv**: Additional lab data related to the patients.

- **results**: Contains processed data and visualization notebooks.
  - **Final_patient_clean_data.csv**: The cleaned dataset that results from the preprocessing steps.
  - **example_data_visualization.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook that demonstrates data visualization techniques applied to the dataset.

- **LICENSE**: Licensing information for this repository.

- **main.ipynb**: The main notebook where data preprocessing, analysis, and prediction tasks are conducted. It includes steps for loading, cleaning, analyzing, and predicting using machine learning models.

- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the repository.

## Project Objectives
1. **Data Cleaning**: Clean and preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and removing outliers.
2. **Statistical Analysis**: Perform statistical analyses to understand patterns and trends in the data. This includes calculating correlations, mean, median, and other statistical measures.
3. **Data Visualization**: Use visualizations to better understand the dataset and to reveal interesting trends and correlations between variables.
4. **Machine Learning Predictions**: Apply basic machine learning models to predict patient outcomes based on features in the dataset. This includes:
   - Training models using features like vaccination status, demographic information, and other relevant parameters.
   - Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy and classification reports.

## Instructions for Use
1. **Data Preparation**: Place raw data files in the `datasets` folder.
2. **Run Data Preprocessing**: Open `main.ipynb` and run the cells to clean and preprocess the data. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and feature selection.
3. **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Explore `example_data_visualization.ipynb` for various visualizations, or use the visualizations in `main.ipynb` to analyze patterns in the dataset.
4. **Prediction**: Use machine learning models in `main.ipynb` to predict patient outcomes based on the dataset features.
